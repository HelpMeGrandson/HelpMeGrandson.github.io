# HelpMeGrandson.github.io
Help Me Grandson is a website to assist the elderly with basic tech issuses in a clear and hard to misinterpret way.
The concept was floated by Kevin Holtz in a Dinosaur BBQ on December 29, 2023
This github repo is a prototype of the final website
As of 12/29/2023 the sole developer of the site, Kyle Holtz, only knows basic HTML, no CSS, and no Javascript.
